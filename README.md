IntruderNet

Or the safe watch of an artificial intelligence setup

Rabbits as a species has a terribly sensitive biology
As such it finds itself highly prone to disease and predators
Wild hares not as much as their fight-or-flight instinct works well
Domesticated rabbits albeit scared at the slightest gust of wind has been bred for meat consumption or a house companion through selective breeding
This selective breeding has made it sensitive to external factors such as temperature, disease, environemnt, predators, sound etc... as I'm more than surely not listed all possible factors which may lead to their death

IntruderNet, as the name implies attempts at an AI to detect intruders
Logic: within cages, especially wooden ones, small predators like: weasels, mice or rats can make their way as an attempt for the cereal diet rabbits have. Weasels not as much, they directly attack rabbits.
It would be ideal if one could retrospect and act accordingly
As such this is what IntruderNet strives: a Transformer Neural Network discriminating between multiple classes:
rabbit
weasel
mouse
rat
dog (surprisingly, there have been incidents, and the mere bark, in the case of gestative rabbit can lead to miscarriage)
